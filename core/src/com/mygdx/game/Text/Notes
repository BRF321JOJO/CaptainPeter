Can make all laser values within laser class by just changing the ID within the class
Therefore can just render all lasers at once

Bugs:
When invaders touch ends of movement, invert order. (Test by shooting invaders in middle).
When invaders touch ends of movement, move in designated space instead of based on how many left
Can play laser sound multiple times at start. (Afterwards doesn't happen). Likely has something to do with the id with laser issue.
Invaders stop shooting laser after some time.
